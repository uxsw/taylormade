<h1>Christmas Email? Think Again</h1>

<p>This time last year I had a big purge of the email lists I was subscribed to. Most I had found myself on by default after buying from that company and while I didn't particularly mind getting the odd email from them, I just felt like I was getting way to many promotional emails throughout the day and it was beginning to annoy me.</p>
<p>Very few survived.</p>
<p>I assumed it was just an accumulation of email lists I'd been added to that had tipped the balance of incoming mail suddenly feeling too much. And this year, by the end of November I was starting to think it was time to get removing myself from some email lists again. Once again I was feeling that too many promotional emails were appearing in my inbox throughout the day. I thought it just happened that after my last purge, I'd been added to various others through the year and the balance was starting to tip again.</p>
<p>Then I saw this blog from Mail Chimp on <a href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/cyber-monday-and-email-fatigue/" title="Email fatigue">Cyber Monday and Email Fatigue</a>, and this makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>They're talking particularly about Thanksgiving, but I think the same will apply for Christmas too. Mail Chimp see a clear spike in the number of emails being sent to customers over this period - and, interestingly, also a very clear spike in the unsubscribe figures - as people like me finally get one email to many and decide to block them all.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about sending out a Christmas email to your customers, think twice.</p>
<p>You might think that because you're emailing with an offer, that customers will be happy with the email. Well, almost all promotional emails I get have an offer in them. The offer in itself won't save you from the cull.</p>
<p>If you send regular (and worthwhile) emails to your customers, I think you are in a better position. Customer might be prepared to sacrifice the occasional high value email for the benefit of a clear inbox - but they might be slower to sacrifice <em>regular</em> high value emails.</p>
<p>Email marketing's a tricky place and difficult to get customers to open and act on your emails. If your big selling period is over Christmas, you should use the rest of the year to perfect your emails. Test different offer types, different email styles, subject lines ... test and retest when the conversion rates are low and when your peak selling period comes around you can be sending out emails that you know are perfectly tailored to your audience.</p>
<p>If you're in a really seasonal niche like Christmas Decorations, then emailing customers year round might be a stretch - but for the majority of businesses it makes sense.</p>
<p>Remember though, that it's only worth sending out regular emails if they're interesting. You need to have good offers and good content. Regular also means <em>regular</em>, not one a week for a couple of months then a two month gap because you've been busy.</p>

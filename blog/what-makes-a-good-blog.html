              <h1>What Makes a Good Blog?</h1>
              <p>
                Whilst researching this blog post, you won’t be surprised to
                find out that I came across scores of other blog posts spouting
                advice on how you go about creating a good blog. Most of it was
                pretty interesting which is good news, but I want to put my own
                two pennies worth in as I’ve a passion for the art of blogging.
                Despite the endless blogs already in existence – estimated at
                160 million in 2010 – there is still a lot of room in cyber
                space for more, particularly when they are done well.

                In essence, what you are aiming for is a focus on great writing
                with a decent nod to the search engines. After all, there is no
                point in creating a masterpiece if nobody can find it. This goes
                for both professional <strong>and</strong> personal blogs,
                unless you are treating your blog like an online diary or
                journal and have no interest in gaining an audience. No doubt
                you will want further criteria on what makes writing for the web
                <em>great</em>, and what sort of nod to the search engines is
                required. Wait no longer. I’ve split my list into a top 5 great
                writing tips and a top 5 great search engine optimisation tips
                in an effort to make things clear.

              <h3>Top 5 Good Blog Writing Tips</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Who/What/When?</strong><br />
                  Before you do anything, answer these 3 key questions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Who</strong> you are writing for? Who is your
                      audience? Do they like a bit of fun? Are they
                      professionals? Are they busy?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>What</strong> are you going to write about? – pick
                      a handful of topics you really feel passionate about (even
                      one!) and think long and hard about whether your ideas and
                      inspiration will dry up on you within the first month
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>When</strong> are you going to write it? – this
                      question is about the frequency you are going to post new
                      articles and the time it takes to write them
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Passion</strong><br />
                  This tip is simple. You just need to have some. Let all that
                  enthusiasm for your subject ooze out into every sentence. That
                  will get them hooked.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Get a Personality</strong><br />
                  The web is swarming with blogs. One way of getting noticed is
                  to be entertaining. In marketing circles, it’s all about
                  <em>engaging with your audience</em>. If you are truly
                  passionate (tip 2) about your subject – be it your own
                  product(s), food, the environment, camera tripods or Paris
                  Hilton – your personality will hopefully push it’s way
                  through. Just remember, there is nothing less engaging than
                  400 – 1,000 words of dry drivel. Be interesting (a bit of
                  useful detail), be funny (use tip 1 to gauge how funny you
                  should be) and above all, be an individual (although, don’t
                  pretend you are Stephen Fry if you are not).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Make it Pretty</strong><br />
                  Unless you are a true wordsmith, gifted with an endless inner
                  supply of fascinating subjects and inspiration, you will get
                  stuck sometimes. Try using imagery – photos, infographics,
                  videos – to jazz things up. Think how well the image-based,
                  social media <em>new kid on the block</em>

                  is doing right now. People are hit with a lot of content
                  nowadays, so some straight-talking pictures can help lighten
                  the load.

                  <strong>About Us</strong><br />
                  This one is important because it allows people to get to know
                  you a bit better. Once someone has connected with your style
                  and personality they will want to know a bit about you.
                  Whether you are a company or an individual, let your readers
                  have some background on you. A professional blogger will no
                  doubt want to give some impressive work credentials, whilst
                  someone blogging on celebrities can put forward some general
                  hobbies and interests. A single paragraph is enough.

              <h3>Top 5 SEO Blog Tips</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Blog Length</strong><br />
                  This one is always up for debate. Basically Google
                  <em>et al</em> are looking for relevant and engaging content
                  that users are interacting with, so your blog can be 400
                  words, it can be 4,000 words, but if people aren’t reading it
                  or, more importantly, search engines aren’t finding it, you
                  won’t be ranked highly. The passion, personality and content
                  play a big part in getting your blog seen. If you continually
                  write very dull 2,000 word blogs, it certainly won’t get you
                  further than someone writing 400 interesting words on a topic.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Title and Opening Paragraph</strong><br />
                  Now, before you start coming up with clever, cryptic titles
                  and teasing opening paragraphs you must remember that search
                  engines use this information to work out what the heck you are
                  on about. If you get too witty and playful with your blog
                  regarding these 2 points confusion will inevitably ensue. One
                  hilarious(!) example of this I found was
                  <a
                    href="http://blog.abstractedge.com/2011/03/an-ancient-rabbis-advice-for-online-marketing//"
                    title="Scott Paley blog"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Scott Paley</a
                  >, who wrote a piece on business goals and critical metrics,
                  titling it
                  <em>An Ancient Rabbi’s Advice for Online Marketing</em> –
                  typing the words <em>rabbi’s advice</em> into Google saw him
                  leap to the top of the search results (Google’s sophisticated
                  algorithms have seen this drop off since); typing ‘business
                  goals and key metrics’ saw him precisely … nowhere in the
                  search results. Keep whimsy under control.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Keywords and Meta Data</strong><br />
                  Keywords, keywords, keywords!! I’m in danger of being
                  penalised by Google for keyword stuffing right there. Whilst
                  that might be an exaggeration, the use of important keywords
                  within your page titles, your page URL and your content is
                  imperative. Otherwise the issues outlined in point 2 will kick
                  in yet again. Writing specifically for search engines is bad
                  practice, but try not to get too creative with your language
                  and remember what you are supposed to be writing about. If
                  it’s a blog on Jennifer Aniston, as an extreme example it
                  would be rather silly to avoid using her name throughout the
                  blog. Constantly referring to her as
                  <em>the girl from Friends with the good hair</em> won’t get
                  you very far in the SERPs (search engine results pages).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Content</strong><br />
                  OK, so this one is relatively simple too. Make sure your blog
                  content is fresh and engaging. A blog that features one post
                  every 6 months is going to bore the socks off both the search
                  engines and your visitors. You need to keep the creative tap
                  flowing, which is why the decision to start a blog in the
                  first place is a big one.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Great Functionality</strong> Remember to offer
                  visitors ways to engage with your blog including a comments
                  area, recent posts links and an index, preferably categorised
                  using clear category headings – clear means recognisable by
                  your visitors and the search engines.
